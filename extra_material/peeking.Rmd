# Peeking & Early Stopping 

## What's the Problem?

* Implementing an A/B test usually not instantaneous

* Analyst can look at the data before the data collection is completed, one or multiple times
    * Known as peeking

* Using standard hypothesis testing procedures when peeking can lead to misleading conclusions
    * Can we adjust our testing procedure to account for peaking?

## Example: XXX 

## Load the Data 

## Peeking

* Suppose we look at the data every 100 observations

* We might be tempted to draw conclusions, given what we observe.

* Suppose our experimentation dashboard shows an estimate of the ATE and 95% confidence interval every time we peek

## Peeking

* After 500 observations we might stop the experiment since the confidence interval no longer includes zero

Is this an OK thing to do?

## Multiple Hypothesis Testing

* Our peeking and deciding approach means we have made **multiple decisions**
    * And tested **multiple hypotheses**

* What are the consequences of doing this?

## Measuring the consequences

**Coverage**:

**Power**:

**False Discovery Rate**:

**Average Experiment Duration**:

## Consequences of Peeking and Deciding

* Coverage seems to be OK. 

* Power is above 80% starting at around 250 observations, 

* The false rejection rate is way higher than the target of 5%


## Correcting For Multiple Hypothesis Testing

Let's examine two adjustments that aim to correct for peeking:

1. Bonferonni Correction
2. Group Sequential Testing

## Bonferonni Correction 

Idea: decrease the significance level Î± proportionally to the number of looks. 

* In particular, instead of using the same $\alpha$ for each look, use

$$
\alpha_{B} = \frac{\alpha}{P}
$$

where P is the number of looks

* Need the number of looks planned in advance!

## Bonferonni Correction

## Group Sequential Testing

* Idea: allow for peeking at any point in time and correct the significance level for the peeking point

* How? define a $\alpha$ spending function that determines how to correct the significance level $\alpha$, given peeking time $t$

$$
f(\alpha,t) = \alpha \ln(1 + (e - 1)t)
$$

where $t = n/N$

* As $t \rightarrow 1$, correction converges to the original significance level 

## $\alpha$ spending function

## Group Sequential Testing

## Summary

* Group sequential testing is  a procedure to do valid inference when peeking during an A/B test,
    * Any number of times, and 
    * At any point during the experiment. 

Peeking does not come for free.
 * The more we peek, the earlier we can stop an experiment but also the higher the false rejection rate.
