# Uplift Modelling 

## What is Uplift Modelling?

* Uplift Modelling: Estimating **conditional** average treatment effects

* What is a conditional ATE?
    * Average treatment effect (ATE) for a subset of the population

* Why do we want to know conditional ATEs?
    * we would like to know for which subjects (patients, users, customers, ...) the treatment works better or worse
* essential intermediate step to improve the targeting of a treatment of interest

## Conditional Average Treatment Effects

* Fundamental problem of causal inference: cannot recover individual treatment effects:
    
    $$
    \tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)
    $$
        
        * We can estimate a conditional average:
        
        $\tau(x) = E[\tau_i | X_i = x]$
            
            i.e. the average effect of treatment on sales for older customers
